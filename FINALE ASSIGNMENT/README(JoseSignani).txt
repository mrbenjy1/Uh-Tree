List of changes/additions

-Added Music to the game

-Added Grain effect to game

-Altered the behavior of a ghost enemy to follows the player instead of waypoints (Minor Mod)

-Added a stamina bar that can only be holds for a limited time before needing to recharge (Major mod)

Biggest challenge - Experimenting with the game's code was a good way to better understand what was possible to alternate in the game, however there were times I found myself wondering how certain codes worked and how I could use them to implementing new  gimmicks.


No this project will most likely not be worked on any further
