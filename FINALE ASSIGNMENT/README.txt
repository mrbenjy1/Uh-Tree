List of changes/additions

-Added Grain effect to game
-Added Music to the game
-Added Minor mod (altered ghost enemy that follows player instead of waypoints)
-Added Major mod (Stamina bar that can only be used for limited time before needing to recharge)

Biggest challange - making the new enemy type was the biggest challange because he was hard to balance, the way he works is that he's speed ramps up as the player takes longer to escape so trying to find a sweetspot to give the player a challenge while letting them have a couple of errors was the hardest part of the project.

No this project will most likely not be worked on any further
