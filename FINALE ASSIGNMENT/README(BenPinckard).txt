List of changes/additions:


-Added Grain effect to game 


-Added Music to the game 


-Added Minor mod (altered ghost enemy that follows player instead of waypoints) 


-Added Major mod (Stamina bar that can only be used for limited time before needing to recharge)


Biggest challenge - The hardest challenge for me was knowing how long the stamina should last for the player. I first had it for a second, but it made the main character run a little funny. So I changed it to last a few seconds and that made it work perfectly.
